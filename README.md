# airline_reservation_project
# This is project made using HTML,CSS-BOOTSRAP,FLASK,and the sqlite database and is a demonstration of a airline reservation system wher a user can register,login,search for flights,add the required travellers and book them by paying through a bank card.
** note:-we did not connect it to real bank database so the payment is only for demonstration purposes.
